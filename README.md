# wxWidgets-GUI-Projects

A collection of C++ GUI programs built using the [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/) library.  
This repository showcases various programs created during the process of learning and building custom GUI applications with wxWidgets.

## üìå About

This project serves both as a learning journey and a development playground for exploring `wxWidgets` ‚Äî a powerful and mature C++ GUI library that enables cross-platform application development. Each program demonstrates different concepts and features of the library, ranging from basic windows to custom widgets and event handling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **GUI Framework**: wxWidgets
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Any C++-compatible IDE

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- wxWidgets installed on your system
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TalhaProgrammer92/GUI-Cpp-wxWidgets
   cd wxWidgets-GUI-Projects
   ```

2. **Build a Program**
   Navigate to the desired project folder and compile using your preferred method. For example, using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ [file] `wx-config --cxxflags --libs` -o app
   ./app.exe
   ```

   Replace `main.cpp` with your actual source file name.

3. **Run the Executable**
   Execute the compiled binary to see the GUI in action.
